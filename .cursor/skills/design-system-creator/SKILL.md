# Design System Creator

Design systems architect and CSS expert specializing in creating comprehensive, scalable design bibles.

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use for:**
- Creating design tokens from scratch (colors, spacing, typography scales)
- Building CSS custom property architectures
- Documenting component libraries with usage guidelines
- Creating design bibles and style guides
- Establishing naming conventions (BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS)
- Auditing existing CSS for design system extraction
- Theming and dark mode token systems
- Multi-brand/white-label token structures

❌ **Do NOT use for:**
- Typography selection and pairing → **typography-expert**
- Color theory and palette generation → **color-theory-palette-harmony-expert**
- Brand identity and visual direction → **web-design-expert**
- Actual component implementation → **web-design-expert** or **native-app-designer**
- Icon design → **web-design-expert**
- Motion design principles → **native-app-designer**

## Three-Tier Token Architecture

The foundation of scalable design systems:

```css
:root {
  /* 1. PRIMITIVE - Raw values */
  --color-blue-500: #3b82f6;
  --space-4: 1rem;

  /* 2. SEMANTIC - Purpose-driven */
  --color-primary: var(--color-blue-500);
  --space-component-padding: var(--space-4);

  /* 3. COMPONENT - Specific usage */
  --button-bg: var(--color-primary);
  --button-padding: var(--space-component-padding);
}
```

→ See `references/token-architecture.md` for dark mode, multi-brand, and complete examples.

## Design Bible Structure

### 1. Foundation
- Brand Identity, Design Principles
- Color System, Typography Scale
- Spacing Scale, Grid System

### 2. Components
For each component document:
- Purpose, Anatomy, Variants
- States (default, hover, active, disabled, focus)
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, screen readers)
- Code examples

### 3. Patterns
- Page Layouts, Navigation
- Forms, Data Display
- Feedback (alerts, toasts, modals)

### 4. Guidelines
- Writing (voice, tone)
- Imagery, Motion, Accessibility

→ See `references/component-documentation.md` for templates.

## CSS Organization (ITCSS)

```
styles/
├── 0-settings/     # Tokens, custom properties
├── 1-tools/        # Mixins, functions
├── 2-generic/      # Reset, normalize
├── 3-elements/     # Typography, forms (unclassed)
├── 4-objects/      # Layout patterns
├── 5-components/   # UI components
├── 6-utilities/    # Helpers, overrides
└── main.css        # Import all
```

→ See `references/css-organization.md` for BEM naming and full structure.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Token Explosion
**What it looks like**: 500+ tokens with overlapping purposes
**Why it's wrong**: Defeats constraints; developers can't choose
**Fix**: Limit to 6-8 spacing tokens. If you need more, fix the scale.

### 2. Missing Semantic Layer
**What it looks like**: Components reference primitives directly
**Why it's wrong**: Can't theme, can't change brand without touching every component
**Fix**: Three-tier tokens: Primitive → Semantic → Component

### 3. Documentation Drift
**What it looks like**: Design bible says one thing, CSS does another
**Why it's wrong**: Developers stop trusting documentation
**Fix**: Generate docs from CSS comments, or use Storybook

### 4. Utility Class Overload
**What it looks like**: `class="p-4 m-2 bg-blue-500 text-white..."`
**Why it's wrong**: HTML unreadable, design intent lost
**Fix**: Use utilities sparingly; most styles in semantic component classes

### 5. Breaking the Scale
**What it looks like**: `padding: 13px;` (why 13?)
**Why it's wrong**: Every exception erodes the system
**Fix**: If the scale doesn't work, fix the scale

### 6. No Version Control
**What it looks like**: "Which button is correct?"
**Why it's wrong**: Multiple sources of truth
**Fix**: Single source of truth with version numbers, deprecation warnings

## Working Process

1. **Audit**: Review existing patterns and inconsistencies
2. **Define**: Establish tokens and foundational system
3. **Build**: Create component library with documentation
4. **Document**: Write comprehensive design bible
5. **Test**: Validate accessibility and responsiveness
6. **Deliver**: Package with examples and starter templates

## MCP Integrations

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **21st.dev** | Scaffold components quickly with modern patterns |
| **Storybook** | Extract existing component structure (when available) |
| **Figma** | Sync design tokens from Figma variables (when available) |
| **Stability AI** | Generate placeholder images for documentation |
| **Firecrawl** | Research design system best practices |

## Output Deliverables
